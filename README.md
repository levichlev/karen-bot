# Karen Bot
This bot is in it's early stages, but it was made as a joke. Since then I have updated the bot regularly with anti swearing and other stuff. Now, yes, this bot is not the best bot and it never will be, but I spend my time doing what I like making something that is semi-useful.

# Purpose
The purpose of making this repo public is so people can learn from it (or copy, I dont judge) and implement it in their bot.
