# Karen Bot
This bot is in it's early stages, but it was made as a joke. Since then I have updated the bot regularly with anti swearing and other stuff. Now, yes, this bot is not the best bot and it never will be, but I spend my time doing what I like making something that is semi-useful.
# Purpose
The purpose of making this repo public is so peaple can learn from it (or copy, I dont judge) and implement it in their bot.

# User development
Anyone who wants to can develop their own commands using the command template and submit it in the "user-dev" branch. I will test it out and include it into the bot if its good.

Also, add your discord username in the command somewhere (maybe with a comment) for a role and maybe a dev chat ;)
# Post Scriptum
I sometimes add song lyrics in responses and stuff. Yes, I love music. Yes, I'm a musician.

# Latest commit
Updated README.md with a purpose.
